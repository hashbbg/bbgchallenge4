This game has been bootstraped in a 12 hours one-shot development for the [#bbg challenge 4](https://github.com/hughfdjackson/bbgchallenge4).

It is not finished, and I may continue it after the challenge ending.

Because the UI is not finished and no help is available in the game, I recommand you to read this small readme.

The game
========
Blazing Race is a against-the-clock platform game
where you control a fireball with your mouse and you 
try to light candles.

Avoid the water or your flame will die.

How To Play
===========

You can only control the fireball using mouse clicks. Click where you want to go.

Each time you click, an amount of power is used (depending on the distance of your click) and you need to wait a few seconds to reload it.

The map
=======

Only 20% of the full map has been implemented for now.

I've a full draft of the map in png format 
but I need to port it in the game with is quite long 
because all polygons has been made with hand.

Maybe a map editor would be nice, but I haven't enough time.

Next
====

I had a lot of ideas I haven't implemented yet in term of

* UI
* graphics and effects
* effect area
* gameplay
* ...
