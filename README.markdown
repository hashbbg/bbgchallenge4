## Rules

#### Submission

Fork my repo, create a folder for your entry, then pull request me when you're done.

#### Content restriction

* Use only content you have a legal right to.
* PG13 content.  There's no problem with serious topics, but curb the explicit content.

#### Time restriction

You have to do all of the actual coding, music making and art making on the game itself within the 12 hours.  Feel free to do research/conceptual stuff outside that, like:

* Thinking/conceptualising
* Drafting game design
* Looking for tools/art/music

#### Libs/tools

Use any lib or tool you like.  It's all fair game ;)

#### Platform

It has to run in a browser! Feel free to specify *which* browser, but remember; if you're too specific, fewer people may end up playing it.
