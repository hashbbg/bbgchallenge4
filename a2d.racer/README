A2D Racer

Entry for 12-hour bbg challenge in april 2012.

Tested and working adequately on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
Makes use of an XHR call to load the level tiles, so it may not run locally
depending on how picky your browser of choice is (start chrome with --allow-file-access-from-files).

The A2D engine is designed with a tower defense game in mind, but it can be used for lots of stuff. 
Or will be, when it is properly finished, the included version is still a work in progress.

All graphics are borrowed and slightly modified from lostgarden.com, where they were placed in public domain.
The retroish font used is provided and hosted by google webfonts, and listed as "Press Start 2P".
Had no time to add sounds, but they would have been generated bleeps and blops ;)

Oh! by the way:
the game is controlled using the arrow keys. Press ESC to return to the main menu,
and if for some reason you find you have exploded, press SPACE to restart.
